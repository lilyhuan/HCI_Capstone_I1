# Soilmill PGH: Increasing Composting in Pittsburgh

This website is part of the senior capstone for Carnegie Mellon's Human Computer Interaction course. The capstone team consists of Lily Huang, Noni Shelton, Elan Suder, and Jailyn Zabala.

We are working with the city of Pittsburgh. The city is using a $90,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture to implement a community compost and food waste reduction pilot. The pilot will be 2 years composed of researching, planning, and implementing composting in the City of Pittsburgh. This is the first part of the program.

## Project Description
For this website, we worked with Aftyn Giles of the Sustainability and Resilience division of the city of Pittsburgh to create a tool to increase composting amongst residents who are interested in composting but havenâ€™t started yet. In the previous research phase of our project, we discovered through interviews with composters in Pittsburgh that community, habit, education, and satisfaction are all crucial factors in why people compost. After several lo-fi, mid-fi, and high-fi iterations, we concluded that this website presented here is the best way to get more people to compost in Pittsburgh.

This website demonstrates one path for a potential user, the DIY Composting path. It consists of the landing page, the quiz, the DIY result, and the FAQs, all with placeholder text. Pittsburgh's technical team will take over and finish the rest of the site. What this entails is building out the rest of the pages (composting results) and replacing the placeholder texts and images. Once the site is completely done, the city will conduct a pilot study where they launch this site in a specific community and see if it gets more people to compost.

This website provides context on why to compost, funnels users to their best composting style, and provides the relevant resources to get started. We hope this to be a valuable addition to the city of Pittsburgh and look forward to the changes this project may bring.
